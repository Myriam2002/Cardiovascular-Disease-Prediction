# üìë 
# - According to WHO , Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. 
# - More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.
# - CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. 
# - It can also be associated with damage to arteries in organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and eyes. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the existence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

# üéØ  **`How can we reduce the Heart diseases death rate?`**

# - The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications.
# - We Aim to deploy a machine learning model that can predict whether the person may have a heart disease or not.

#  ü©∫ <span style="font-size:35px;background-color:#ccffdd; color :#009933">Our Problem</span>

# - Predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the patient examination results.

# 
# 
# There are 2 types of input features:
# 
# - Objective: factual information;
# - Examination: results of medical examination;
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# **`sex : 1 = Male , 0=Female`**
# 
# **`cp : Chest Pain`**
# - Angina: Angina is caused when there is not enough oxygen-rich blood flowing to a certain part of the heart. The arteries of the heart become narrow due to fatty deposits in the artery walls. The narrowing of arteries means that blood supply to the heart is reduced, causing angina.
#     Value 0: typical angina || Value 1: atypical angina || Value 2: non-anginal pain || 3: asymptomatic
#     
# 
# **`threstbps :Resting blood pressure`**
# - ( Normal pressure with no exercise )
#  
#  
# **`chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl`**
# - Cholesterol means the blockage for blood supply in the blood vessels
# 
# 
# **`fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl`**
# - (1 = true; 0 = false) blood sugar taken after a long gap between a meal and the test. Typically, it's taken before any meal in the morning.
#     
#     
# **`restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)`**
# - ECG values taken while person is on rest which means no exercise and normal functioning of heart is happening
#          
# **`thalach: maximum heart rate achieved`**
#           
# **`exang: exercise induced angina`**
# - (1 = yes; 0 = no) is chest pain while exercising or doing any physical activity.
# 
# **`oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest`**
# - ST Depression is the difference between value of ECG at rest and after exercise.
# - An electrocardiogram records the electrical signals in your heart. It's a common and painless test used to quickly detect heart problems and monitor your heart's health. Electrocardiograms ‚Äî also called ECGs or EKGs ‚Äî are often done in a doctor's office, a clinic or a hospital room. ECG machines are standard equipment in operating rooms and ambulances. Some personal devices, such as smart watches, 
#      
# **`slope:	the slope of the peak exercise ST segment`**
# - Value 0: upsloping ‚Äî Value 1: flat ‚Äî Value 2: downsloping
#  
# **`ca:	number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy`**
# - Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving images of the interior of an object. In its primary application of medical imaging, a fluoroscope (/Ààfl ä…ôr…ôsko äp/) allows a physician to see the internal structure and function of a patient, so that the pumping action of the heart or the motion of swallowing, for example, can be watched

# üìå
# # `Conclusion`:
# - üö® The ratio of male has heart disease is 32.2%, a little bit higher than female (24%).
# - üö® We might think that more number of men have heart disease but if we observe closely, we can see that more proportion of female have heart disease as compared to men as (69.9647% Males , 30.0353% Females), Males persentage is more that double women persentage.  
# - üö® According to Harvard Health Publishing. Heart attacks strike men at younger ages than women. But survival rates are worse in women.

# - üö® From the second graph, people who have heart disease and people who do not have lie in the same range from (30 : more than 70).

# # `Conclusion`:
# - üö® According to the medicine knowledge, if the major vessels colored by flourosopy get more, it means that the risk of heart disease will be lower. So, vessel flourosopy examination for everyone is a very important process to diagnose whether the people has heart disease or not.
# - üö® Graph shows that the patients suffering from Heart Diseases have high values of Major Vessels (CA).
# - üö® Wheras the patiets not suffering from Heart Diseases have very low values of Major Vessels.
# - üö® The more blood movement (Number of Major Vessels) the better.
# - üö® So people with ca equal to 0 are more likely to have Heart Diseases.
# - üö® CA Number have a significent effect in Heart Diseases prediction.

# ## `Restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results)` vs `Target` :

# In[62]:


plt.hist([df[df.target==0].restecg, df[df.target==1].restecg], bins = 20, alpha = 0.5, label = ["no_heart_disease","with heart disease"])
plt.xlabel("restecg")
plt.ylabel("Percentage")
plt.legend()
plt.show()


# üìå
# # `Conclusion`:
# - üö® A large proportion of people having restecg of type 1 (having ST-T wave abnormality) actually have heart disease. We must take care of ST-T Wave abnormality as it can range from mild symptoms to severe problems.
# - üö® Restecg has a significent effect in Heart Diseases prediction.

# ## `Thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)` vs `Target` : 

# In[63]:


plt.hist([df[df.target==0].thalach, df[df.target==1].thalach], bins = 40, alpha = 0.5, label = ["no_heart_disease","with heart disease"])
plt.xlabel("thalach")
plt.ylabel("Percentage")
plt.legend()
plt.show()


# üìå
# # `Conclusion`:
# - üö® The patients having maximum heart rate greater than 150 are at a greater risk of having heart disease.
# - üö® Thalach has a significent effect in Heart Diseases prediction.
